#  Why Learn Data Structures & Algorithms

## Interviews
When you interview for a software engineering position, chances are that you’ll be tested on data structures and algorithms. Having a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms is the “bar” for many software engineering positions.

## Work
Using an appropriate data structure is crucial when working with lots of data. Using the right algorithm plays a significant role in the performance and scalability of your software. Your mobile apps will be more responsive and have better battery life. Your server apps will be able to handle more concurrent requests and use less energy. Algorithms often include proofs of correctness that you can leverage to build better software.

## Self-Improvement
Knowing the strategies used by algorithms to solve tricky problems gives you ideas for improvements that you can make to your own code. The Swift standard library has a small set of general-purpose collection types; they definitely don’t cover every case. And, yet, as you will see, these primitives can be used as a great starting point for building more complex and special-purpose constructs. Knowing more data structures than just the standard array and dictionary gives you a bigger collection of tools that you can use to build your own apps.
