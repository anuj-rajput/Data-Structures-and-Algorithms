#  Linked List

A linked list is a collection of values in a linear unidirectional sequence. A linked list has several theoretical advantages over contiguous storage options such as the Swift Array:
- Constant time insertion and removal from the fron of the list
- Reliable performance characterstics

A linked list is a chain of nodes. Nodes have two responsibilities
- Hold a value
- Hold a reference to the next node. A nil value represents the end of the list
