#  Trees

The **tree** is a data structure which is used to:
- Represent hierarchical relationships.
- Managing sorted data
- Facilitating fast lookup operations

## Terminology
### Node
Like the linked list, trees are made up of **nodes**. Each node encapsulates some data and keeps track of its children.

### Parent and child
Every node is connected to exactly one node above it. That node is called **parent** node.
The nodes directly below and connected to it are called its **child** nodes. In a tree, every child has exactly one parent.

### Root
The topmost node in a tree is called the **root** of the tree. It is the only node that has no parent.

### Leaf
A node is a leaf it has no children
